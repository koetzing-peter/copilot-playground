# Copilot Code Style

- For unit testing, always use the `pytest` module
module and avoid mocking whenever possible.
- Follow the `PEP8 style guide` for Python code
and limit `line length` to 79 characters.
- Always use `hanging indentation` for line breaks
- Don't put the `closing brace/bracket/parenthesis` on a separate line
as this will prevent code folding in most editors.
- Use `single quotes` for strings.
- Use `type annotations` for all functions and methods.
- Use `docstrings` for all functions and methods,
but don't repeat the function signature in the docstring.
- Use the `logging` module for logging, and avoid using `print'.

When reviewing code, check that

- The `code is easy` to understand, modify and maintain.
- `Idiomatic Python` has been used
- No parameters have been `hardcoded`
- Functions and methods do `one thing only`
- New features are `not over-engineered`
- `Avoid duplication` of code
- Implementation is `simple and straightforward`
