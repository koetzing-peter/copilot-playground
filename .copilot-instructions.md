# Copilot Code Style

- For unit tests always use the `pytest` module
and avoid mocking whenever possible.

- Stick to PEP8 style guide for Python code
and limmit the line length to 79 characters.

- Always use hanging indentation for line continuations

- Don't put closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on a separate line.

- Use double quotes for strings.

- Use type hints for all functions and methods.

- Use docstrings for all functions and methods,
but don't repeat the function signature in the docstring.

- Use the `logging` module for logging and avoid using `print`.
